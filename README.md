📝 Project Update: Text Area with Live Word Count | HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript

I built a Text Area with Live Word Counter using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript!
This project allows users to type into a text box while instantly seeing the word count update in real-time.

🔹 Key Features:

Clean and responsive UI designed with Tailwind CSS

Live word count as the user types

Instant feedback for better writing experience

Mobile-friendly and lightweight

This small project helped me practice real-time DOM updates, event handling, and responsive UI design.
Always learning and improving through building! 🚀
